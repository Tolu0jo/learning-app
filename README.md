2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd `
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. note: Postgresql and prisma are used in this project and you can access the DB with prisma studio.
5. Setup relevant environment variables as sampled in the example.env file.

## Running the App from your terminal

1. From the project folder run the following command to start the backend server: `yarn start:dev`
2. The backend server will be running at http://localhost:3030.
